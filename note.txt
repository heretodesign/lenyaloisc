   3 Main Task:
        1. Data Driven Organization :
            1.1: 12 Questions Radio button [ Progress 95% ]
                - Currently working on exporting it into a pdf template
                - Mapping the final results

           1.2: & and 6 Questions Multiple selection [ Progress 70% ] 
                - We are waiting for the finalised questions and Answers from Stam and Simon within the next few weeks. 
                - We are also waiting for the algorithm to do the required mapping once the questions are confirmed.
                - 

        2. TheCads Learning: The scheduling dynamic page. [ Progress 10% ]
                - Experimenting Phase: We are waiting for the actuall template from the vendor next Friday. 
                - So we are currently doing 2 testing rounds, one with a wordpress plugin for scheduling events. It is calendar based so there is a possibility that adding - updating and changing courses might be a limitation with the plugin. 
                - and Secondly, with a hard coded method. The simpliLearn website was designed using angular4 and a cloud based database side. So we are trying to

That is so cool, to kind of have a restful week. 

Definitely better for sure. My Greek boss is here for the next 3weeks, he works remotely from Athens and comes around every few months. When he's here, it kinda means more project meetings and updates. I generally dont enjoy long meetings - but as the lead developer I cant bail out. I also have a friend visiting from the US, basically he is a friend of a friend of mine. So I've been hanging out with him for a fair bit as well. 

yea I honestly get to thoroughly process a lot haha, journal journal and measure the sacrifice it'll take to see my dreams become a reality. I have spent the last 12years pursuing God and what He has for me. There's a LOT I want to do with my one life. A lot to sacrifice to see that happen as well. I've withdrawn my passion from any activity, habits - basically anything that is not part of taking me there. And just channeled it in the right areas - I also have a soft spot for missions & missionaries in general. 


tension / conflict in relationships is just inevitable. Its maturity to know the best time to do confrontations and when to reconcile as well. I think being self-aware has helped me a lot relationally-emotionally. To be able to know whats going on internally and what my capacity is for that day [esp that I work waaaaaay longer hours] - I've gotten into way less tense moments and fights because of that. The enemy takes out waaay to many relationships & families because of offense and conflict. So to do relationships well we have to create a culture that values open communication & facilitates reconciliation we things doesnt go well. I consider doing Family well to be the highest blessing in life, so I've made it a goal to just get equipped in that sense. My trips to Botswana often feels like these as well, our siblings & families fight a lot, hold grudges longer, dont see eye to eye - and often its something soo small that we fight over or that divides us. And often everyone waits for me to come and initiate reconciliation. Any holiday home that is fight free amongst my siblings is like christmas.
